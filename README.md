# ReduxTodoApp
Very simple TodoApp with Redux as data flow manager and Cloudant NoSQL service as database.

### Configuration

First you should create [Cloudant Account](https://console.bluemix.net/)
Next you should create your own Cloudant NoSQL DB.

You need your own `username`, `password` and `db` and then you should complete a `src/config.ts.sample` file (config.ts.sample is only sample)

### Running

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Verify the application by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
http://localhost:8000
```
